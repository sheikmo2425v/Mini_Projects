# Mini_Projects
During my training period, I developed several mini projects using Python with frameworks like Flask and Django, along with frontend technologies such as React JS with CSS and Bootstrap 5. I also worked on projects using React Native for mobile app development. For data storage, I used various databases including SQLite, MySQL, and MongoDB.

# Websrcab and data handle
I developed a web scraping tool to extract data from a website and identify repeated words within the scraped data. The extracted data is then displayed in an Excel file and also presented in the Python compiler using the pandas library. To accomplish this, I made use of several Python libraries including sqlite3, sys, matplotlib, urllib.request, matplotlib.pyplot, bs4, collections, xlsxwriter, pandas, numpy, and rake_nltk
 
# Tic Tac Toe(X-O)
I created a simple local multiplayer game using React JS. The game is designed to be played by two players on a website. The logical concepts used in the game are based on your own opinions and implementation. It involves managing the game state, handling player turns, validating moves, and determining the winner. The goal is to create an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience for the players.
# Bank With flask 
The "Bank With Flask" project is a simple banking program that uses Flask, SQLite, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

# Website generator  
I developed a full-stack website generator using Python, Flask, MySQL database, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The website allows users to perform various operations such as inserting data, updating data, deleting data, and viewing data. It provides a user-friendly interface implemented with HTML and CSS, and interactive functionalities are implemented using JavaScript and jQuery. The backend is built using Python with the Flask framework, and a MySQL database is used to store and manage the website's data.
